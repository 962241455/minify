Simply add a dependency on matthiasmullie/minify to your composer.json file if you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage the dependencies of your project:

```sh
composer require matthiasmullie/minify
```

Although it's recommended to use Composer, you can actually include these files anyway you want.
